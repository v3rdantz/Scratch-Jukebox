# Scratch-Jukebox

Here's the link to my Scratch Jukebox:

Click the green flag, enter your name when prompted, and, using the magic of Text to Speech, the Scratch Jukebox will insert your name into personalized versions of 4 different songs! The cat will dance while the music plays.

To hear "Hey There Delilah" by the Plain White T's, click the radio.
To hear "Jolene" by Dolly Parton, click the microphone.
To hear "Layla" by Eric Clapton, click the speaker.
To hear "Billie Jean" by Michael Jackson, click the keyboard.

To stop a song while it's playing, click its sprite again. 

*To avoid chaos and overlapping sounds, sprites of the other songs are not clickable while a current song is playing. They become clickable again once the current song is stopped by the user or finishes playing.*
